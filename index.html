          Hi and welcome to my Portfolio website. <br /><br />
          My name is Eduardo and I am a Portuguese man born and raised in
          Lisbon, but living in the UK with my wife and two sons, for more than
          6 years now. <br /><br />
          My professional dream is to become a successful, highly skilled
          web-developer and I am open to any job propositions that will help me
          to kick start my new career. <br /><br />
          Two years ago I found myself experimenting with creating a website and
          a passion for learning code emerged.<br /><br />
          Before this, I have had a highly successful career in the hospitality
          sector, working my way up to Head Sommelier and Restaurant Director in
          high-end luxury venues. A career that was full of memorable moments
          and achievements like being awarded Sommelier of the year by Wine
          Magazine or placing in the top 3 for 3 consecutive years in the most
          prestigious national sommelier competition in my country. My long and
          successful career in hospitality will hopefully be very useful in
          terms of transferable soft skills to my new and ambitious professional
          goals.
        </p>

      <p>
        Since I discover how happy coding made me feel, I've been learning as
        much as I can from online courses, tutorials and numerous websites from
        Stack Overflow to W3Schools or MDN.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, the opportunity arose with the first coding Bootcamp in the UK
        promoted by Trilogy at the University of Birmingham. Excited with the
        perspective of having structured and intense learning, I immediately
        enrolled and I am currently half way in the course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this Portfolio website, I am posting projects that I develop or have
        an active participation. I hope you like them.
