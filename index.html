          Hi and welcome to my Portfolio website. <br />
          My name is Eduardo and I am a 42-year-old Portuguese man born and
          raised in Lisbon. <br />
          My professional dream is to become a successful, highly skilled
          web-developer. <br />
          Two years ago I found myself experimenting with creating a website and
          a passion for learning code emerged.<br />
          Before this, I have had a highly successful career in the hospitality
          sector, working my way up to Head Sommelier and Restaurant Director in
          high-end luxury venues. A career that was full of memorable moments
          and achievements like being awarded Sommelier of the year by Wine
          Magazine or placing in the top 3 for 3 consecutive years in the most
          prestigious national sommelier competition in my country. My long and
          successful career in hospitality will hopefully be very useful in
          terms of transferable soft skills to my new and ambitious professional
          goals.
        </p>

      <p>
        Since I discover how happy coding made me feel, I've been learning as
        much as I can from online courses, tutorials and numerous websites from
        Stack Overflow to W3Schools or MDN.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, the opportunity arose with the first coding Bootcamp in the UK
        promoted by Trilogy at the University of Birmingham. Excited with the
        perspective of having structured and intense learning, I immediately
        enrolled and I am currently in the initial stage of the course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this Portfolio website, I will be posting the projects I will be
        making in Bootcamp. For now, and just for fun, I have posted some
        websites I have made before starting the course and that are currently
        live. These ones were made using website builders, so they don't realy
        represent my ambition, but I hope you like them anyway.
